- **Control (accident death)**: Violent and fast death Deaths due to accident, blunt force trauma or suicide, terminal phase estimated at < 10 min [Healthy]. 
- **Control (unexpected death)**: Fast death of natural causes Sudden unexpected deaths of people who had been reasonably healthy, after a terminal phase estimated at < 1 hr (with sudden death from a myocardial infarction as a model cause of death for this category) [Healthy].
- **Control (intermediate death)**: Intermediate death Death after a terminal phase of 1 to 24 hrs (not classifiable as 2 or 4); patients who were ill but death was unexpected [Diseased].
- **Control (ventilator case)**: Ventilator Case All cases on a ventilator immediately before death [Diseased].
- **Control (slow death)** : Slow death Death after a long illness, with a terminal phase longer than 1 day (commonly cancer or chronic pulmonary disease); deaths that are not unexpected [Wasting].

We thank the participants and their families who donated their muscle tissues for research purposes. We would also like to extend special thanks to the authors of these publicly available muscle datasets, which will facilitate further research in the future.
